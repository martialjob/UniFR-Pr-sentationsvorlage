	abstract = {Objectives:
              Patients’ stays in the ICU are often characterized by prolonged immobility, sedation, disrupted sleep, and extended periods of pain, which put ICU patients at greater risk for ICU-acquired weakness and delirium-related mortality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of using meditative virtual reality to improve the hospital experience of ICU patients.
            
            
              Design:
              Final report of prospective observational trial.
            
            
              Setting:
              Surgical and trauma ICUs of the University of Florida Health, an academic hospital.
            
            
              Patients:
              Fifty-nine nonintubated adult ICU patients without delirium at recruitment.
            
            
              Interventions:
              Patients were exposed to sessions of commercially available meditative virtual reality applications focused on calmness and relaxation, performed once daily for up to 7 days.
            
            
              Measurements and Main Results:
              
                Outcome measures included pain level, pain medication administration, anxiety, depression, sleep quality, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, delirium status, and patient ratings of the virtual reality system. Comparisons were made using paired
                t
                tests and mixed models. The virtual reality meditative intervention improved patients’ ICU experience with reduced levels of anxiety and depression; however, there was no evidence that virtual reality had significant effects on physiologic measures, pain, or sleep.
              
            
            
              Conclusions:
              The use of meditative virtual reality technology in the ICU was easily implemented and well-received by patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: non-pharmacological interventions to prevent delirium are useful in hospitalised older adults. However, they are poorly implemented in clinical practice. We aimed to develop a software for bedside use by hospitalised older adults and to improve their access to these interventions., METHODS: a transdisciplinary team composed of healthcare professionals, designers, engineers and older adults participated in the development of the software. Scrum methodology was used to coordinate the work of the team, and the software was evaluated in a feasibility study., RESULTS: a software for touchscreen mobile devices that supports Android 5.0 or later was produced, including modules for time-spatial re-orientation, cognitive stimulation, early mobilisation, sensorial support use promotion, sleep hygiene and pain management optimisation. Horizontal disposition, use of colour contrast and large interaction areas were used to improve accessibility. The software's usability and accessibility were evaluated in 34 older adults (average age 73.2 +/- 9.1 years) showing that 91.1\% of them got access to all the software functions without previous instructions. The clinical feasibility assessment showed that 83.3\% of the 30 enrolled hospitalised patients (76 +/- 8 years) completed the 5-day protocol of software usage during hospitalisation. Software use was associated with a decreased trend in delirium incidence of 5 of 32 (15.6\%) at baseline to 2 of 30 (6.6\%) after its implementation., CONCLUSION: a highly accessible and implementable software, designed to improve access to non-pharmacological interventions to prevent delirium in hospitalised older adults, was developed. The effectiveness of the software will be evaluated in a randomised clinical trial. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the British Geriatrics Society.

              Objective
              Machine learning models trained on electronic health records have achieved high prognostic accuracy in test datasets, but little is known about their embedding into clinical workflows. We implemented a random forest–based algorithm to identify hospitalized patients at high risk for delirium, and evaluated its performance in a clinical setting.
            
            
              Materials and Methods
              Delirium was predicted at admission and recalculated on the evening of admission. The defined prediction outcome was a delirium coded for the recent hospital stay. During 7 months of prospective evaluation, 5530 predictions were analyzed. In addition, 119 predictions for internal medicine patients were compared with ratings of clinical experts in a blinded and nonblinded setting.
            
            
              Results
              During clinical application, the algorithm achieved a sensitivity of 74.1\% and a specificity of 82.2\%. Discrimination on prospective data (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve = 0.86) was as good as in the test dataset, but calibration was poor. The predictions correlated strongly with delirium risk perceived by experts in the blinded (r = 0.81) and nonblinded (r = 0.62) settings. A major advantage of our setting was the timely prediction without additional data entry.
            
            
              Discussion
              The implemented machine learning algorithm achieved a stable performance predicting delirium in high agreement with expert ratings, but improvement of calibration is needed. Future research should evaluate the acceptance of implemented machine learning algorithms by health professionals.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Our study provides new insights into the implementation process of a machine learning algorithm into a clinical workflow and demonstrates its predictive power for delirium.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Early identification of inpatients at risk of developing delirium and implementing preventive measures could avoid up to 40\% of delirium cases. Machine learning (ML)-based prediction models may enable risk stratification and targeted intervention, but establishing their current evolutionary status requires a scoping review of recent literature., METHODS: We searched ten databases up to June 2022 for studies of ML-based delirium prediction models. Eligible criteria comprised: use of at least one ML prediction method in an adult hospital inpatient population; published in English; reporting at least one performance measure (area under receiver-operator curve (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, positive or negative predictive value). Included models were categorised by their stage of maturation and assessed for performance, utility and user acceptance in clinical practice., RESULTS: Among 921 screened studies, 39 met eligibility criteria. In-silico performance was consistently high (median AUROC: 0.85); however, only six articles (15.4\%) reported external validation, revealing degraded performance (median AUROC: 0.75). Three studies (7.7\%) of models deployed within clinical workflows reported high accuracy (median AUROC: 0.92) and high user acceptance., DISCUSSION: ML models have potential to identify inpatients at risk of developing delirium before symptom onset. However, few models were externally validated and even fewer underwent prospective evaluation in clinical settings., CONCLUSION: This review confirms a rapidly growing body of research into using ML for predicting delirium risk in hospital settings. Our findings offer insights for both developers and clinicians into strengths and limitations of current ML delirium prediction applications aiming to support but not usurp clinician decision-making.

	abstract = {Background: A wide range of reviews have demonstrated the effectiveness and tolerability of Virtual Reality (VR) in a range of clinical areas and subpopulations. However, no previous review has explored the current maturity, acceptability, tolerability, and effectiveness of VR with intensive care patients. Aim(s): To identify the range of uses of VR for intensive care patients, classify their current phase of development, effectiveness, acceptability, and tolerability. Method(s): A scoping review was conducted. A multi-database search was undertaken (inception to January 2021). Any type of study which examined the use of VR with the target application population of intensive care patients were included. Screening, data extraction, and assessment of quality were undertaken by a single reviewer. A meta-analysis and a descriptive synthesis were undertaken. Result(s): Six hundred and forty-seven records were identified, after duplicate removal and screening 21 studies were included (weak quality). The majority of studies for relaxation, delirium, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) were at the early stages of assessing acceptability, tolerability, and initial clinical efficacy. Virtual Reality for relaxation and delirium were well-tolerated with completion rates of target treatment of 73.6\%, (95\% CI:51.1\%-96\%, I2 = 98.52\%) 52.7\% (95\% CI:52.7\%-100\%, I2 = 96.8\%). The majority of reasons for non-completion were due to external clinical factors. There were some potential benefits demonstrated for the use of VR for relaxation, delirium, and sleep. Conclusion(s): Virtual Reality for intensive care is a new domain of research with the majority of areas of application being in the early stages of development. There is great potential for the use of VR in this clinical environment. Further robust assessment of effectiveness is required before any clinical recommendations can be made. Relevance to Clinical Practice: Virtual reality for ICU patients is in its infancy and is not at a stage where it should be used as routine practice. However, there is early evidence to suggest that virtual reality interventions have good acceptability and tolerability in intensive care patients for relaxation, delirium, and improving sleep.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Delirium is a common and frequently underdiagnosed complication in acutely hospitalized patients, and its severity is associated with worse clinical outcomes. We propose a physiologically based method to quantify delirium severity as a tool that can help close this diagnostic gap: the Electroencephalographic Confusion Assessment Method Severity Score (E-CAM-S)., DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study., SETTING: Single-center tertiary academic medical center., PATIENTS: Three-hundred seventy-three adult patients undergoing electroencephalography to evaluate altered mental status between August 2015 and December 2019., INTERVENTIONS: None., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We developed the E-CAM-S based on a learning-to-rank machine learning model of forehead electroencephalography signals. Clinical delirium severity was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method Severity (CAM-S). We compared associations of E-CAM-S and CAM-S with hospital length of stay and inhospital mortality. E-CAM-S correlated with clinical CAM-S (R = 0.67; p {\textless} 0.0001). For the overall cohort, E-CAM-S and CAM-S were similar in their strength of association with hospital length of stay (correlation = 0.31 vs 0.41, respectively; p = 0.082) and inhospital mortality (area under the curve = 0.77 vs 0.81; p = 0.310). Even when restricted to noncomatose patients, E-CAM-S remained statistically similar to CAM-S in its association with length of stay (correlation = 0.37 vs 0.42, respectively; p = 0.188) and inhospital mortality (area under the curve = 0.83 vs 0.74; p = 0.112). In addition to previously appreciated spectral features, the machine learning framework identified variability in multiple measures over time as important features in electroencephalography-based prediction of delirium severity., CONCLUSIONS: The E-CAM-S is an automated, physiologic measure of delirium severity that predicts clinical outcomes with a level of performance comparable to conventional interview-based clinical assessment.

The aim of this study was to describe incidence of delirium, risk factors for delirium, and the association between delirium and circadian light for patients in the ICU., METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of all patients at a Danish ICU from 1 August 2015 to 31 January 2016. Exclusion criteria were heavy sedation, no Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) scores, or inability to communicate in Danish. Delirium was defined as at least one positive CAM-ICU score or treatment with haloperidol. Three of nine beds at the ICU had a circadian light installation. Allocation to ICU beds with or without circadian light depended on availability at admission. Risk factors for development of delirium were analyzed by simple and multiple logistic regression., RESULTS: We included 183 patients in the study. The incidence of delirium was 28\% (95\% CI 22, 35). Allocation to beds with or without circadian lighting was not associated with delirium incidence (OR 1.14; 95\% CI 0.55, 2.37; P = 0.73). We found that Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) (OR 1.03; 95\% CI 1.01, 1.06; P = 0.002), and dexmedetomidine was associated with delirium (OR 4.14; 95\% CI 1.72, 10.03; P = 0.002)., CONCLUSION: In this population of patients admitted to an ICU during 6 months, the incidence of delirium was 28\%.

This study was undertaken to explore the psychosocial impact and communication effects of eye-tracking devices in the ICU., METHODS: A convenience sample of patients in the medical ICU, surgical ICU, and neurosciences critical care unit were enrolled prospectively. Patients participated in 5 guided sessions of 45 minutes each with the eye-tracking computer. After completion of the sessions, the Psychosocial Impact of Assistive Devices Scale (PIADS) was used to evaluate the device from the patient's perspective., RESULTS: All patients who participated in the study were able to communicate basic needs to nursing staff and family. Delirium as assessed by the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit was present in 4 patients at recruitment and none after training. The device's overall psychosocial impact ranged from neutral (-0.29) to strongly positive (2.76). Compared with the absence of intervention (0 = no change), patients exposed to eye-tracking computers demonstrated a positive mean overall impact score (PIADS = 1.30; P = .004). This finding was present in mean scores for each PIADS domain: competence = 1.26, adaptability = 1.60, and self-esteem = 1.02 (all P {\textless} .01)., CONCLUSION: There is a population of patients in the ICU whose psychosocial status, delirium, and communication ability may be enhanced by eye-tracking devices. These 3 outcomes are intertwined with ICU patient outcomes and indirectly suggest that eye-tracking devices might improve outcomes. A more in-depth exploration of the population to be targeted, the device's limitations, and the benefits of eye-tracking devices in the ICU is warranted. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Background: Long-term care facilities (LCFs) in South Korea have limited knowledge of and capability to care for patients with delirium. They also often lack an electronic medical record system. These barriers hinder systematic approaches to delirium monitoring and intervention. Therefore, this study aims to develop a web-based app for delirium prevention in LCFs and analyse its feasibility and usability. Method(s): The app was developed based on the validity of the AI prediction model algorithm. A total of 173 participants were selected from LCFs to participate in a study to determine the predictive risk factors for delerium. The app was developed in five phases: (1) the identification of risk factors and preventive intervention strategies from a review of evidence-based literature, (2) the iterative design of the app and components of delirium prevention, (3) the development of a delirium prediction algorithm and cloud platform, (4) a pilot test and validation conducted with 33 patients living in a LCF, and (5) an evaluation of the usability and feasibility of the app, completed by nurses (Main users). Result(s): A web-based app was developed to predict high risk of delirium and apply preventive interventions accordingly. Moreover, its validity, usability, and feasibility were confirmed after app development. By employing machine learning, the app can predict the degree of delirium risk and issue a warning alarm. Therefore, it can be used to support clinical decision-making, help initiate the assessment of delirium, and assist in applying preventive interventions. Conclusion(s): This web-based app is evidence-based and can be easily mobilised to support care for patients with delirium in LCFs. This app can improve the recognition of delirium and predict the degree of delirium risk, thereby helping develop initiatives for delirium prevention and providing interventions. Moreover, this app can be extended to predict various risk factors of LCF and apply preventive interventions. Its use can ultimately improve patient safety and quality of care.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delirium is a serious condition often experienced by critically ill patients in intensive care units (ICUs). The role of circadian light for this condition is unclear. The aim of this study was to describe incidence of delirium, risk factors for delirium, and the association between delirium and circadian light for patients in the ICU., METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of all patients at a Danish ICU from 1 August 2015 to 31 January 2016. Exclusion criteria were heavy sedation, no Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) scores, or inability to communicate in Danish. Delirium was defined as at least one positive CAM-ICU score or treatment with haloperidol. Three of nine beds at the ICU had a circadian light installation. Allocation to ICU beds with or without circadian light depended on availability at admission. Risk factors for development of delirium were analyzed by simple and multiple logistic regression., RESULTS: We included 183 patients in the study. The incidence of delirium was 28\% (95\% CI 22, 35). Allocation to beds with or without circadian lighting was not associated with delirium incidence (OR 1.14; 95\% CI 0.55, 2.37; P = 0.73). We found that Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) (OR 1.03; 95\% CI 1.01, 1.06; P = 0.002), and dexmedetomidine was associated with delirium (OR 4.14; 95\% CI 1.72, 10.03; P = 0.002)., CONCLUSION: In this population of patients admitted to an ICU during 6 months, the incidence of delirium was 28\%. We did not find an association between circadian light and development of delirium. Copyright © 2017 The Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica Foundation. Published by John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

This pilot study enrolled and followed 15 individuals with dementia (mean age = 83, mean admission Mini-Mental State Examination score = 14.8) and their caregivers daily for the duration of their hospitalization. Results indicated 100\% adherence by nursing staff on the delirium assessment decision support screens and 75\% adherence on the management screens. Despite the prevalence and severity of delirium in people with dementia, there are currently no published reports of the use of the electronic medical record in delirium detection and management.

	abstract = {A well-formulated research question should incorporate the components of a ‘problem’, an ‘intervention’, a ‘control’, and an ‘outcome’—at least according to the PICO mnemonic. The utility of this format, however, has been said to be limited to clinical studies that pose ‘which’ questions demanding correlational study designs. In contrast, its suitability for descriptive approaches outside of clinical investigations has been doubted. This paper disagrees with the alleged limitations of PICO. Instead, it argues that the scheme can be used universally for every scientific endeavour in any discipline with all study designs. This argument draws from four abstract components common to every research, namely, a research object, a theory/method, a (null) hypothesis, and the goal of knowledge generation. Various examples of how highly heterogenous studies from different disciplines can be grounded in the single scheme of PICO are offered. The finding implies that PICO is indeed a universal technique that can be used for teaching academic writing in any discipline, beyond clinical settings, regardless of a preferred study design.},

	doi = {10.2147/CIA.S44926},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Delirium is associated with poor outcomes following acute hospitalization. A specialized delirium management unit, the Geriatric Monitoring Unit (GMU), was established. Evening bright light therapy (2000-3000 lux; 6-10 pm daily) was added as adjunctive treatment, to consolidate circadian activity rhythms and improve sleep. This study examined whether the GMU program improved sleep, cognitive, and functional outcomes in delirious patients., METHOD: A total of 228 patients (mean age = 84.2 years) were studied. The clinical characteristics, delirium duration, delirium subtype, Delirium Rating Score (DRS), cognitive status (Chinese Mini-Mental State Examination), functional status (modified Barthel Index [MBI]), and chemical restraint use during the initial and predischarge phase of the patient's GMU admission were obtained. Nurses completed hourly 24-hour patient sleep logs, and from these, the mean total sleep time, number of awakenings, and sleep bouts (SB) were computed., RESULTS: The mean delirium duration was 6.7 +/- 4.6 days. Analysis of the delirium subtypes showed that 18.4\% had hypoactive delirium, 30.2\% mixed delirium, and 51.3\% had hyperactive delirium. There were significant improvements in MBI scores, especially for the hyperactive and mixed delirium subtypes (P {\textless} 0.05). Significant improvements were noted on the DRS sleep-wake disturbance subscore, for all delirium-subtypes. The mean total sleep time (7.7 from 6.4 hours) (P {\textless} 0.05) and length of first SB (6.0 compared with 5.3 hours) (P {\textless} 0.05) improved, with decreased mean number of SBs and awakenings. The sleep improvements were mainly seen in the hyperactive delirium subtype., CONCLUSION: This study shows initial evidence for the clinical benefits (longer total sleep time, increased first SB length, and functional gains) of incorporating bright light therapy as part of a multicomponent delirium management program. The benefits appear to have occurred mainly in patients with hyperactive delirium, which merits further in-depth, randomized controlled studies.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This research is part of an international project to design and test a home-based healthcare robot to help older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or early dementia. The aim was to investigate the perceived usefulness of different daily-care activities for the robot, developed from previous research on needs., DESIGN: Qualitative descriptive analysis using semistructured interviews. Two studies were conducted. In the first study, participants watched videos of a prototype robot performing daily-care activities; in the second study, participants interacted with the robot itself., SETTING: Interviews were conducted at a university and a retirement village., PARTICIPANTS: In study 1, participants were nine experts in aged care and nine older adults living in an aged care facility. In study 2, participants were 10 experts in aged care., RESULTS: The themes that emerged included aspects of the robot's interactions, potential benefits, the appearance, actions and humanness of the robot, ways to improve its functionality and technical issues. Overall, the activities were perceived as useful, especially the reminders and safety checks, with possible benefits of companionship, reassurance and reduced caregiver burden. Suggestions included personalising the robot to each individual, simplifying the language and adding more activities. Technical issues still need to be fixed., CONCLUSION: This study adds to knowledge about healthcare robots for people with MCI by developing and testing a new robot with daily-care activities including safety checks. The robot was seen to be potentially useful but needs to be tested with people with MCI. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

	abstract = {This paper addresses the emergence of a humanist discourse within nursing and questions the extent to which it represents the panacea implied within much of the humanist nursing literature. Particular attention will be given to whether it represents an ontological and epistemological framework capable of understanding the social, economic and political dynamics formative in the structuring of nurse‐client relations. It will be argued that the humanist analyses extant within much nursing literature are vague, idealistic, inconsistent and inadequate in the sense that they offer little by way of a meaningful analysis of power. A critique will also be made of the methodological individualism implicit within much humanist analyses. The paper will go on to identify the influence of humanist approaches on transcultural theory, and the manner in which the epistemological foundations of the latter have shared the limitations of the humanist nursing approach generally. As such, the transcultural nursing literature is often vague, inconsistent in its use of terminology, lacking in any rigorous analysis of power, and suspect in its conceptualizations of culture. Its capacity for enabling nurses to examine critically the socio‐economic and political dynamics of nurse‐client relations and develop strategies for addressing racisms, considered by many to be endemic within nursing and the health care system generally, is seriously undermined.},

Significant findings were the needs of the Turkish patients for good communication, physical contact and understanding of their culture-based expressions of illness. The German nurses and physiotherapists expressed the need for language barriers to be minimized and for education in the specific culture of Turkish patients. Our findings are discussed from an ethical viewpoint. The International Council of Nurses’ code of ethics is used to guide the ethical debate about the findings within the context of transcultural and multicultural care.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Intercultural communication has become increasingly important in nursing due to the cross-border mobility of patients, health professionals and students. Development of cultural competence continues to be a challenge, particularly among professionals such as educators or healthcare providers who work in professions requiring communication across cultural boundaries. Despite challenges in nursing education related to cultural diversity, competence in intercultural communication has been proven to empower students and to help them grow professionally., OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe clinical mentors' experiences of their intercultural communication competence in mentoring culturally and linguistically diverse nursing students during completion of their clinical practice., DESIGN: Qualitative study design., PARTICIPANTS: The participants were 12 nurses who had previously mentored at least two culturally and linguistically diverse nursing students., METHODS: Data were collected during spring 2016 using semi-structured interviews of 12 mentors working in specialized nursing care at one hospital located in central Finland. Data were analyzed using deductive-inductive content analysis. The main concepts of the Integrated Model of Intercultural Communication Competence were used during the semi-structured theme interviews and during analysis. These concepts include empathy, motivation, global attitude, intercultural experience and interaction involvement., RESULTS: Mentors stated that empathy motivates them in the development of intercultural communication. Mentors experienced a lack of resources and support from their superiors, which caused psychological and ethical strain and reduced mentors' motivation. Mentors openly admitted that they had experienced fear towards unknown cultures, but that this fear was reduced through positive mentoring experiences and cultural encounters., CONCLUSIONS: Continuous education on intercultural communication competence could succeed to further develop clinical mentors' mentoring expertise, which could have the potential to greatly benefit students, patients and staff. Such education could be designed, implemented and measured for its effect in collaboration between health care organizations and higher educational institutions. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Background: The increasing growth of migrant populations in Spain has changed the cultural profile of healthcare system users. Cultural competence in health care settings has become an increasing worry for health professionals, specifically for nurses. Therefore, the training in cultural competency of nursing students is indispensable. Objective(s): To explore the views on the use of high-fidelity simulation in fourth-year nursing students to improve their cultural competence. Method(s): A qualitative descriptive study was conducted with an interpretative phenomenological approach. Before and after taking part in simulated scenarios, 56 semi-structured interviews were conducted. We explored the perceptions of the nursing students when addressing a simulated clinical case with a patient who is a migrant, including the training deficiencies in cultural competences perceived before the simulation, the benefits perceived, and the improvement suggestions. We also analyzed their views on the skills and knowledge developed during the simulation experience. Result(s): Before entering the simulation scenario, we found the existence of insecurity, uncertainty, and cultural differences in the nursing students, with the main worry being the language barrier. They also mentioned the need to improve their intercultural communication and cultural adaptation of the care in their training. After finishing the simulation, they indicated positive aspects, aspects to be improved, learning acquired, and learning to be strengthened, highlighting the existing cultural differences and asking for training on cultural competence. Conclusion(s): The use of high-fidelity simulation provides a positive learning experience, which increases a student's comfort when working with patients of varied cultural origins. Its usefulness in teaching is found in its capacity to develop communication skills and interpersonal skills, such as empathy, in the students. This study provides evidence on the importance of specific training on cultural competence in the Nursing Degree, and the usefulness of high-fidelity clinical simulation to achieve this.

            Abstract
            
              Background
              Based on the experience of six clinical ethicists working at university hospitals in Germany, a structured examination of the field of training in the context of clinical ethics education and training was conducted.
            
            
              Methods
              The process was guided by the question of what needs to be considered when designing different kinds of ethics education and training within an institution. The methodological approach to answering this explorative question consisted of a multistage, descriptive procedure, which was implemented in both joint working sessions and individual work between the sessions.
            
            
              Results
              
                The article provides an overview of the range of possible educational formats, which can help those who want to design and implement training on ethical issues in their institution. Furthermore, it presents an overview of
                directly structuring
                and
                indirectly structuring
                characteristics that need to be considered during implementation. Examples are given to show which variations in format with directly structuring characteristics have proven to be successful in the selected university hospitals. The article provides a basis for discussion in order to promote the structured analysis of conceptual questions of ethical training in the clinical setting.},

	abstract = {Klinisches Assessment durch die professionelle Pflege beruht auf dem Erheben relevanter subjektiver und objektiver biopsychosozialen Daten und deren fachgerechter Interpretation. Die Körperuntersuchung liefert primäre objektive Daten basierend auf vier Verfahren: Inspektion, Perkussion, Palpation und Auskultation. Pflegende in vielen Ländern betrachten die Körperuntersuchung als wesentliche Quelle klinischer Information. Die problemorientierte Beurteilung der körperlichen und psychischen Verfassung eines kranken Menschen ist eine im Pflegealltag kontinuierlich erforderliche Maßnahme, und eingehende Körperuntersuchungen sind ein wiederkehrendes Element der erweiterten vertieften Pflegepraxis auf Masterniveau. Im vorliegenden Artikel wird die Bedeutung der Körperuntersuchung für das klinische Assessment in der professionellen Pflege besprochen, entsprechende Verfahren dargestellt und an Beispielen illustriert. Die Bedeutung einer vertieften Ausbildung in den entsprechenden Fertigkeiten der Körperuntersuchung, und die Integration in Lehrpläne von Studiengängen der Pflegewissenschaft werden aufgezeigt.
          , 
            Clinical Assessment by professional nurses relies upon appropriate gathering and interpretation of relevant subjective and objective biopsychosocial data. The physical examination provides primary objective data through the use of four techniques: inspection, percussion, palpation, and auscultation. In many countries the physical examination of patients is regarded as a standard source of clinical information for nurses. In daily nursing practice problem-focused physical examination is the rule, though complete physical examinations are commonly used in advanced nursing practice at the Master level. In this article the role of physical examination in professional nursing assessment is described, physical examination techniques are introduced and illustrated via case examples. The importance of including assessment competencies in academic nursing education is emphasized.},
